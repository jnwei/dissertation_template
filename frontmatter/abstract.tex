In order to develop new molecules and materials to meet the world's growing energy demands, we must make the process for discovering new materials more efficient. Machine learning provides several avenues for accelerating the discovery pipeline. In the past five years, researchers have used machine learning to perform complicated tasks, such as playing go, which were previously thought to be only possible by humans. Machine learning models have already begun to accelerate materials discovery: identifying new candidates for organic LEDs, and predicting simple synthetic routes for organic molecules. 

In my PhD work, I have developed machine learning models for three different challenges in chemistry. I have developed models to optimize molecules for targeted properties by first compressing molecular space into a continuous, vector representation. I have developed models for predicting reactions within selected families of molecules. I have also developed a model which can predict mass spectra for small molecules in milliseconds, making it possible to expand the coverage of mass spectral libraries and what compounds they can identify. Together, these models can be used to help chemists identify new promising molecule candidates, predict reactivity of these molecules, and characterize the compounds using mass spectrometry. Looking ahead to the next decade of materials discovery, machine learning will likely play a central role in the discovery and synthesis of new molecules.
