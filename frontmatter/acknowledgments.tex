In my PhD I have had the privilege of working at the confluence of machine learning and chemistry. I have several people to thank for introducing me into this domain.

First of all, I thank my advisor, Prof. Alan Aspuru-Guzik. His infectious energy and enthusiasm, as well as his creative drive, has always spurred me on to pursue ambitious and exciting projects. When I first started graduate school, I could not have imageind that I would end up working with machine learning models, or that my thesis would be comprised entirely of this work. It is a testament to his forethought and willingness to let students to explore new fields that my PhD took the course that it did.

I thank my committee members. As my the focus of my PhD switched from applying conceptual DFT methods for predicting reactions to machine learning applications, my committee has also gone through transitions. I'd like to thank Prof. Roy Gordon, Prof. Finale Doshi-Valez, and Prof. Alexander Rush for being on my committee at various times during my PhD. Special thanks goes to Prof. Efthimios Kaxiras, who has been on my committee throughout my PhD. I have really appreciated all of the advice and guidance over the years.

I would like to thank Prof. David Duvenaud, who patiently mentored me on my very first project in applying machine learning to chemistry. He gave me a lot of feedback on how to design the experiments, how to think of good metrics for measuring the results.

I also would like to thank my colleagues in the Aspuru-Guzik lab.  There aren't many groups out there where any group member is more than willing to give you an hour of their time to help you brainstorm an idea, to teach you a new concept, or to listen to your latest frustrations with the publishing process or with the computer cluster. There are so many people to name that I will not endeavor to name everyone except for a few: Rafa, thank you for being one of my first mentors in the group, and teaching me how think critically on my earliest projects. Ben, thank you for being a great sounding board for machine learning ideas and always taking the time to help me figure out that hack in an Jupyter notebook or in RdKit. Joey Knightbrook, Thomas Markovich, and Sam Blau, thanks for taking me under your wing as a fledgling graduate student, and for the career path afterwards. Florian H{\"a}se, L{\"o}ic Roch, Daniel Tabor,
 thank you for the chocolate, pool, and advice as I wrapped up this PhD.

Thank you to all of my mentors and people I've reached out to for advice throughout graduate school. Amy Gilson, thank you for being one of my first mentors, and teaching me the value of reaching out and emailing people to get the help you need. I am glad that we stayed in touch and became friends even after we first met through HWIC.

Thank you to the Google Brain Cambridge team for an awesome internship. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to help me learn to write better code, and be a better machine learning researcher. I look forward to joining the team and working with you all on new and exciting applications of machine learning to chemistry.

I thank my friends in my cohort. I enjoyed our campaigns through Pandemic, Gloomhaven, and the many, many games of Terraforming Mars.
I thank my friends outside of the Harvard Chemistry Department. There is nothing like a quick chat with someone outside the department to help put my problems into some perspective.
Deborah Hanus and Ashley Villar, thank you for bringing me into your reading group, and helping me develop confidence in reading machine learning papers. Deborah, thank you for convincing me to sign up and attend WiML 2016.
I really think that that workshop helped me feel like I could fit into the machine learning community. I've attended both NeurIPS and WiML every year since then.
Harvard Dragonboat, thanks for being such a great community of paddlers and support network. I always looked forward to the summers where I could paddle along the river with everyone again.

Thank you Jeep. You have brought so me much joy, laughter, compassion, hugs, validation, and more through these trying years of graduate school, and for that, I am deeply grateful.

Finally, and most importantly, I thank my parents. Thank you for fostering my interest in science at a young age. Thank you for teaching me how to be a thoughtful, and critically thinking human being. And thank you for your everlasting support, through high school, through college, to today, to make this PhD possible.
