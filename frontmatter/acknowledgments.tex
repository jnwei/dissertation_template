In my PhD I have had the privilege of working at the confluence of machine learning and chemistry. I have several people to thank for introducing me into this domain.



First of all, I thank my advisor, Prof. Alan Aspuru-Guzik. His infectious energy and enthusiasm, as well as his creative drive, has always spurred me on to pursue ambitious and exciting projects. When I first started graduate school, I had no idea that I would end up working with machine learning models, or that my thesis would be comprised entirely of this work. With his guidance and the guidance from collaborators, I was able to start working in this field... [reword later]



I would like to thank David Duvenaud, who mentored me on my first project in applying machine learning to chemistry. [Mention other collaborators? Google Brain?]



I thank my committee members. As my the focus of my PhD switched from applying conceptual DFT methods for predicting reactions to machine learning applications, my committee has also gone through transitions. I'd like to thank Prof. Roy Gordon, Prof. Finale Doshi-Valez, and Prof. Alexander Rush for being on my committee at various times during my PhD. Special thanks goes to Prof. Efthimios Kaxiras, who has been on my committee throughout my PhD.



I also would like to thank my colleagues in the Aspuru-Guzik lab. I have found this group to be extremely friendly, with any group member more than willing to give you an hour of their time to explain something, or give advice about anything. The daily conversations have helped me get through the daily grind of a PhD.



I thank my friends in my cohort. I enjoyed the weekly game nights, and enjoyed our campaigns through Pandemic, Gloomhaven, and the many, many iterations of the terraforming of Mars. 



I thank Jeep, who has never failed to make me smile, or help cheer me up through a tough time.



Finally, I thank my parents, who encouraged my curiosity for science and help support me as I pursued this and other interests.
