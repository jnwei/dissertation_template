There are several important factors to consider when designing a machine learning project in chemistry. The first is to consider the contents of the dataset to use. The second is to consider which representation to use when representing the molecules or inputs to the machine learning model. The third is to consider the objective of the model. Is the goal of the model to predict certain properties or results? Or is it to generate a new molecule, or perhaps a new synthetic route? 

I will discuss the first two points regarding datasets and representation in this introduction. The third question is a rather open ended question and will depend on the end goal of the users. The second half of this dissertation explores three different applications with different objectives for each project.
