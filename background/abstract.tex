Machine learning is the practice of identifying useful patterns from a dataset which then can be transformed into a model. This model can then be used to make predictions given similar types of inputs, or to generate outputs that are similar to the inputs that were given to the model. Models that are used to make predictions are known as discriminative models, whereas models that are used to generate output that is similar to the original dataset is known as a generative models.
